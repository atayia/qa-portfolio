# Heat QA Solutions - QA Portfolio

Welcome to my Quality Assurance portfolio. I am building the Heat QA Solutions brand as a professional identity for my QA work, learning projects, and future career growth. This repository showcases my Manual QA work, with Automation QA projects coming soon.

This portfolio is intended primarily for:
- **Recruiters** – to review my QA skills, documentation style, and testing approach.
- **Future professional opportunities** – including long-term roles and potential freelance work.

## Portfolio Overview

Each client folder contains:

- **Test Cases** — feature-grouped test cases in Markdown format  
- **Screenshots** — evidence of executed tests (sensitive information censored)  
- **Bug Reports** — sample or demo bug reports  
- **Requirements** — sample requirement documents  
- **Test Plans** — test plan documents  

Additionally, the repository includes:

- **index.html** — the website homepage to showcase the portfolio online  
- **styles.css** — the stylesheet used for portfolio pages

## How to View Test Cases

1. Open the folder for the desired website (Amazon, Delta, Macy's).  
2. Open the `*-tests.md` file to view feature-grouped test cases.  
3. Screenshots are included in the `screenshots/` folder and referenced in the Markdown files.  

> Example: In Amazon tests, the invalid login screenshot is linked as:
>
> `![Invalid Password](screenshots/amazon-login-failed.PNG)`

## Notes

- Automation QA will be added to the portfolio in the future.
